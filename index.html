Sorry, but this Hello World page is as far as I got with this. :-/

GitHub recommends I set up Jekyll to manage this web page.
That apparently involves installing Jekyll and its various dependencies
(ruby, bundler) on my Windows PC.  So basically I would be building
and managing this web page on my PC and then pushing the content
to GitHub.  I can't complain since it's free, and I would learn a lot
by doing this, but if I have to manage the CMS myself, I suspect simpler
options (a free WordPress page?) exist.
